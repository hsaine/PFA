<h1 align="center">Abstract</h1>
<p>A comparative study was conducted using Python and Pmaze
to evaluate the performance of DFS, BFS, and A* search algorithms in path planning for a maze. The main objective of
the project was to compare the efficiency of these algorithms
in terms of path cost and algorithmic complexity. No physical
robot was used in this study as it focused solely on the analysis
of search algorithms. This study contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field of path planning by exploring
different approaches for mazes using Python and Pmaze.</p>
